      description:
        'I have been working with programming since 2015 (Over 8 years of experience), I am a full-stack developer, working with a range of technologies, like Java, JavaScript, and other web frameworks. I have experience in developing and maintaining software applications, ensuring code quality, and optimizing performance. Moreover, I have led a team with 3 people, I was responsible for creating their tasks and analyzing them as well. I really believe that code quality is one of the most important things for excellent software work. So that is the reason I am all the time reading articles and keeping me updated about the new technologies on the market. Therefore, I believe that my ability to work very well in the group and my hard work to deliver high-quality code align with the values of the company. I am excited about the opportunity to work at Avanade, because like me you are constantly innovating about technologies and ideas for the better of the people.

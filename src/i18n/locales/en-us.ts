        'Hello, my name is Darlan D. Candiotto, It is a pleasure to see you here. I have been working with programming since 2015, I am a full-stack developer, working with a range of technologies, like Java, JavaScript, and other web frameworks. I have experience in developing and maintaining software applications, ensuring code quality, and optimizing performance. Moreover, I have led a team with 3 people, I was responsible for creating their tasks and analyzing them as well. I really believe that code quality is one of the most important things for excellent software work. So that is the reason I am all the time reading articles and keeping me updated about the new technologies on the market.',

        'Hello, my name is Darlan D. Candiotto, It is a pleasure to see you here. \nI am a Java and JavaScript software developer. I started my career in 2015 with mobile development (native android). However, during all my years as a programmer, I have got experience in full-stack development, working on the front-end with JSF and ReactJS technologies, and on the back-end with NodeJS and Java (Spring Boot). Moreover, I have jobs with React Native as well.',
